They Feed the Nation (Food Sovereignty)

A king traditionally provides for and protects his people. Farmers grow the food that sustains everyone—from the poorest to the richest. Without farmers, no industry or city can survive. This makes them the backbone of a country’s economy.

2️⃣ Foundation of the Economy

In countries like India, agriculture employs a huge part of the population and contributes significantly to GDP. Historically, even kings relied on taxes from farmers (land revenue) to run their kingdoms. In that sense, the farmer’s work sustains the entire state.

3️⃣ Independence & Dignity

A king is often seen as self-sufficient. A farmer similarly works on his/her own land, produces his/her own food, and in many cases lives independently, not depending on others for survival.

4️⃣ Moral & Cultural Respect

Many cultures view the farmer as noble and hardworking. In Indian literature, you often see phrases like “Annadata Sukhi Bhava” (may the food-giver be happy), which elevates the farmer’s status to that of a benefactor — akin to a king in terms of importance.

5️⃣ Control Over Resources

Historically, those who control food supply also control power. Farmers literally “rule” over the production of the most essential resource—food—without which no kingdom, army, or government can stand.

6️⃣ Sacrifice for Others

Kings were idealized as people who sacrificed for their people. Farmers work hard, often under harsh conditions, not just for themselves but for feeding millions. That selflessness grants them a moral “kingship.”
